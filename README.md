# My-First-Config-Setup-On-Fedora


## Original Intention

This repo is being made with the intention to learn to use, maintain, and configure my Linux setup. I'm not a Linux expert by any means and I just want to learn how to maintain my system and improve my understanding of Linux

### Why I'm choosing Fedora for this project

I've been using linux as a regular user for 7 years now. Fedora was the first distro that made me feel safe and confident while using linux. 

**Fedora is**

- A solid distribution with a major team working behind it
- Stable while keeping up to date with new technologies
- It's a RHEL derivative, so it takes the benefits of a professional system down to the normal users
- It brings an opportunity to switch from home usage to professional usage.

## What I'm learning

- Linux system configuration
- Shell scripting
- Git and Documentation
- Debugging and problem solving

## Things Done so Far. 

- Creation of basic scripts to install packages and repositories on a fresh fedora installation
- Setting up my work environment (mainly neovim)
- The start of my wayland configuration. 

## To-do's

- Write documentation for each script, config, and file added to this repo
- Keep learning

## Disclaimer

This is a learning project. I'm doing this with the intention to learn new skills and document my learning process. If someone else can beneffit from this and helps other people to better understand Linux as a system would be a secondary effect but this is not meant to be official documentation.
